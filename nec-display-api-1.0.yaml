        Set the current backlight. Range is 0-100. n, +n  Change the current
        setting to +n.  If the sign is omitted, it is treated as a positive
        number. -n     Change the current setting to -n.  If there is a negative
        sign, it is treated as a negative number. ++X    Change the current
        value to current_value + X.  If there is a ++ sign, shift the specified
        value in the + direction.
               The amount of movement depends on the OSD.
        --X    Change the current value to current_value - X.  If there is a --
        sign, shift the specified value in the - direction.
               The amount of movement depends on the OSD.
        If the value of the paramter is not within a valid range the response
        will be an error.  For example, if 15 is specified, but valid values are
        0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, then an error is returned.
